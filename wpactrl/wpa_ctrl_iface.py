''' # Incompatibilities

Generally, socker errors are handled in a more pythonic manor.
While the original wpa_ctrl.c implementation deals with a lot of error
handling and returns different error codes (as it surely should, since it's
a C library), this implementation simply does not handle socket exceptions.

## wpa_ctrl_request()
* Does not use cmd_len, since there's really no need for this in the python implementation.
* Does not take a reply buffer pointer, since we'll just receive into a new string.
  It does however use reply_len as size hinting for recv.
* The msg_cb only takes a msg argument, not len.

## wpa_ctrl_recv()
* Does not take a reply buffer pointer, for the same reason mentioned for wpa_ctrl_request()
